<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vishal35198/Sarcasam-detection/blob/main/Sarcasm.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect sarcasm in text. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data and identify sarcastic statements effectively.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **`Sarcasm.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, model building, and evaluation process.
- **Datasets**: The datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **Preprocessing**: Text preprocessing steps to clean and tokenize data.
- **Model**: Machine learning model used for sarcasm detection.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Notebook
You can run the notebook directly on Google Colab by clicking the badge above. Make sure to upload the required dataset and follow the steps in the notebook to train the model.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (mention depending on what the notebook uses)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or any other relevant libraries

## ðŸ“Š Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in sarcasm detection.
